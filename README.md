# Data Structure Laboratory
This repository contains the assignments I completed as part of the Data Structures & Algorithms Laboratory course under the 2019 pattern syllabus for the Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering at Pune University (SPPU).

The assignments in this repository focus on implementing and understanding various data structures and algorithms, fundamental to computer science and engineering. Each assignment corresponds to a specific concept or data structure, and the solutions are implemented in C++ or Python as specified.

## Assigment 1: Student Database using Python
- **Que.** Write a Python program to store marks scored in subject “Fundamental of Data Structure” by N students in the class. Write functions to compute following:      
  a) The average score of class.  
  b) Highest score andlowest score of class.  
  c) Count of students who were absent for the test.    
  d) Display mark with highest frequency.

## Assignment 2: String Operations
- **Que.** Write a Python program to compute following operations on String:  
  a) To display word with the longest length.  
  b) To determines the frequency of occurrence of particular character in the string.  
  c) To check whether given string is palindrome or not.  
  d) To display index of first appearance of the substring.
  e) To count the occurrences of each word in a given string.

## Assignment 3: Set Function
- **Que.**  Write a Python program using functions to compute following:  
  a) List of students who play both cricket and badminton.  
  b) List of students who play either cricket or badminton but not both.  
  c) Number of students who play neither cricket nor badminton.  
  d) Number of students who play cricket and football but not badminton.

## Assignment 4: Binary Search And Fibonacci Search
- **Que .** Write a Program to store roll no. of Sudents in array attended training program in sorted order.     
Write a function for searching whether particular student attended training program or not using binary and fibonacci search.
**Files :** `A4.py`  

## Assignment 5: Selection Sort And Bubble Sort
- **Que.** Write a C++ program to store first year percentage of students in array. Write function for sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using    
a) Selection Sort      
b) Bubble sort and display top five scores.
